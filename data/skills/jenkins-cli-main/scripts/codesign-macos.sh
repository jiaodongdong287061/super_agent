# Sign ad-hoc with an explicit Designated Requirement pinned to the identifier.
#
# Without -r, codesign derives a DR of the form `cdhash H"..."` which changes
# on every rebuild. Each new jk release would therefore invalidate any "Always
# Allow" the user granted in Keychain and re-prompt on the next invocation.
# Pinning the DR to the identifier makes the DR stable across rebuilds so the
# Keychain ACL keeps matching after `brew upgrade jk`.
#
# Security trade-off: any other ad-hoc binary that claims this identifier
# satisfies the DR. Acceptable because the Keychain item only stores a user-
# scoped Jenkins API token, trust is granted per-context by the user
# explicitly via `jk auth login`, and the identifier is namespaced under our
# GitHub org. Upgrading to Developer ID is tracked as separate future work.
